The Android MDM Dashboard allows you to manage your mobile fleet with the same features of our Web Dashboard but from the comfort of your Android device.

Flyve MDM is a Mobile Device Management software that enables you to secure and manage all the mobile devices of your business or family via an Admin Dashboard app or Web Dashboard.

You can join the community in GitHub and participate to contribute, test and correct bugs: [Flyve MDM on GitHub](https://github.com/flyve-mdm)!

The Android MDM Dashboard is under the [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

You will be able to control the following aspects of your mobile fleet:

* Files & Apps

Select which apps and files will be installed or unistalled from the devices enrolled.

* Security

Includes a range of powerful features to protect sensitive company data stored on mobile devices, allowing you to manage your mobile fleet security policy with precision.

Set the specification of the passwords such as the length, type of characters, quality level, and others, also you'll count with the option to wipe the device in case of failed attempts to unlock, or in case of lost or theft.

Lock the device so unauthorised individuals can't have access to the business information.

* Peripherals

Disable the access and connectivity through the peripherals of the devices.

* Geolocation

Find your devices wherever they are at the moment or within a period of time.

* Mobile Fleet Inventory

Create an inventory of all of your company terminals, you will be able to gather the most important information of the devices, such as battery status, memory, etc.
