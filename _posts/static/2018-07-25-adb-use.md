## SDK Tools

To diagnose and solve issues more quickly, we require useful information from the Android Debug Bridge.

### Download SDK Platform Tools

Get the SDK Tools according to your operating system from [Developers Android Web site](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).

Unzip the file in any directory, be sure to remember which!

### How to use

#### 1. Add the path to the folder

In every OS you must add the path to the directory where you unziped the platforms-tool, in order to execute the adb commands.

- On Linux or MacOS you can add it in your terminal configuration file.

export PATH="$HOME/*your/path/to*/platform-tools:$PATH"

- On windows you must check documentation according to your version.

##### Workaround

On Mac OS or Linux, open a terminal, go to the folder in which you unziped the platform tools, run the commands with the following syntax:

```./adb```

To test run: ```./adb help```, you should see the help output.

#### 2. Activate USB debug on your device

USB debug is a feature available from the Developer Options, to enable this option go to Settings > About > Build number, tap 7 times the build number and you should see several messages indicating the count down to become a developer.

Once the the developers options are enabled, just check the option USB debugging.

#### 3. Connect your device through USB

#### 4. Check your device is connected

Open a terminal on your computer and run: ```adb devices```

You should see your device listed.

#### 5. Get LogCat of the issue

- Run the following command:

```adb logcat```

- Repeat the steps to reproduce the error you found

You should see an output of several lines been writen constantly, after you get the error on the device, use ```ctrl + c``` to stop the terminal.

#### 6. Contribute

Save the output in a file and add it in your issue, we really appreciate your contribution, this will help us solve your issue quickly.
